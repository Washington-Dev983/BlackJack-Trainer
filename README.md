# BlackJack Trainer

## Summary
This is a simple blackjack simulator that I made to practice blackjack skills. It's the beginning of a bigger project focused on statistics and probability study. I was heavily inspired by the movie 21 to make this. Nice movie by the way, I recommend it.

## Current version features
    1. Player vs Dealer
    2. Accurate multideck tracking
    3. Low card reshuffling

## Future Plans
    1. Betting
    2. Running and true count tracking
    3. AI players
    4. Adaptation to Fast AI for web app interface

## How to run
    1. Have python installed
    2. run Game.py
